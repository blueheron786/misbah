# Misbah

![.NET Core CI](https://github.com/blueheron786/misbah/actions/workflows/dotnet-tests.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)

An open-source note-taking app focused on storing and linking ideas.

## Getting Started

To get started, create a "hub," a directory that will contain folders and files for your notes.

If you are looking to switch over from Obsidian, you can open your Obsidian vault and start working with it directly. All notes and folders will exist in the same structure, albeit plugins and custom code won't execute.
