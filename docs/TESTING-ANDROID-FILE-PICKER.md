3. This selects `/storage/emulated/0/Documents/Notes`

### Option B: Browse Existing Files
1. First, use a file manager to put some `.md` files somewhere
2. Click **"Browse Files"**
3. Navigate to that folder and pick any file
4. App will use that folder

### Option C: Custom Path
1. Click **"Select Folder"**
2. Type the full path to your notes folder

## Debugging

If you see issues, check the browser console (Chrome DevTools) for messages like:
- `"User selected path: /storage/emulated/0/Documents/Notes"`
- `"Path access test for '/path/here': true"`
- `"Hub selected: '/path/here'"`

## Creating Test Content

To test properly, create some markdown files:

```bash
# Using a file manager app, create these files:
/storage/emulated/0/Documents/Notes/test1.md
/storage/emulated/0/Documents/Notes/test2.md
```

Content example:
```markdown
# Test Note
This is a test note for Misbah app.

## Features
- Markdown support
- File organization
- Mobile friendly
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Loading" Never Goes Away
- Check console for path selection messages
- Verify the folder exists and has `.md` files
- Try different folder with existing content

### "No Folders Found"
- The selected path doesn't exist or is empty
- Try a different path or create some test files
- Check file permissions

### File Picker Doesn't Open
- Permissions might not be granted
- Try "Select Folder" option instead
- Check if Capacitor plugins are working

The enhanced picker should provide a much better experience! üöÄ
